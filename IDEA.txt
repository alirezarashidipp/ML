Technical Highlights:
Data Validity: Ground truth established via expert consensus, validated by Fleiss' Kappa (Inter-Annotator Agreement) to ensure objective training data.
Feature Engineering: A hybrid vector of 25 features, utilizing NLP preprocessing to combine traditional readability formulas (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid) with custom linguistic and structural indicators.
Core Model: XGBoost Classifier utilized for ordinal classification, optimized via Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation and SMOTE for class imbalance handling.
Scoring Mechanism: Class probabilities are converted into a continuous scalar (0-95) using Mathematical Expectation to capture granular quality shifts.
Aggregation Logic: The final 5-star rating is derived using the Cobb-Douglas Utility Function. This integrates the ML-based readability score with heuristic structural flags (Who/What/Why/Acceptance Criteria), enforcing a non-compensatory scoring policy (strict adherence to standards).
Interactive Sandbox & GenAI Assistant: A pre-submission front-end interface allowing users to validate descriptions in real-time. Includes a Conditional GenAI Rewriter that activates only upon meeting a minimum quality threshold (3-star gate), ensuring the AI refines valid inputs rather than hallucinating on poor data.
Executive Analytics Dashboard: A comprehensive visualization layer providing macro-level insights into organizational requirement quality. It aggregates daily metrics with granular segmentation (e.g., by Department) to monitor long-term trends and adoption rates.
Explainability: Model decisions are interpreted using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to provide actionable feedback to users.
