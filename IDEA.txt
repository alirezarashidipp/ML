Project Title: Automated Readability Scoring System for Jira User Stories (MVP)

Abstract: This project aims to enhance the quality of technical requirements by deploying a supervised machine learning model to assess the readability and structural completeness of Jira User Stories.

Technical Highlights:

Data Validity: Ground truth established via expert consensus, validated by Fleiss' Kappa (Inter-Annotator Agreement).

Feature Engineering: A hybrid vector of 25 features, including traditional readability formulas (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid) and custom linguistic/structural indicators.

Core Model: XGBoost Classifier utilized for ordinal classification, optimized via Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation and SMOTE for class imbalance handling.

Scoring Mechanism: Class probabilities are converted into a continuous scalar (0-95) using Mathematical Expectation.

Aggregation Logic: The final 5-star rating is derived using the Cobb-Douglas Utility Function. This integrates the ML-based readability score with heuristic structural flags (Who/What/Why/Acceptance Criteria), enforcing a non-compensatory scoring policy to ensure strict adherence to standard User Story formats.

Explainability: Model decisions are interpreted using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to provide actionable feedback.
